Inner Peace is a Web-based Application (Prototype) intended for patients to maintain mental health by consulting or looking for tips about psychology through the application. This application is still a prototype because it does not have a back-end. This application was built by myself using HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks.

# Features
- Patients can choose to consult via chat, virtual call, or meet directly with a psychologist
- Psychologists are selected based on the patient's closest location (consultation via face-to-face meeting)
- Patients cannot choose a psychologist when they first consult, but are chosen randomly by our team, so that all psychologists are treated fairly
- However, patients can consult the same psychologist for the next consultation if they feel they are compatible with that psychologist
- Psychologists can post psychological content on our app
- Psychologists can find out a patient's personality through their profile
